Okay, so I want to develop a readme for my project in which I am making an app. I am using Django for backend and Flutter for frontend. So, your duty is to ask me so many questions one by one and create a readme. So, the readme should have two aspects. One is the logical aspect which is non-technical and one is the technical aspect. So, let's start. Ask me questions one by one and accumulate that data in a whole document and then create a readme. And make sure it is in good format. It is very uniquely formatted. And yes, start.

Updated saved memory
Great, Nishant! Let's begin crafting your README step-by-step. I’ll first gather details about the logical (non-technical) side of your app, then move to the technical part. I'll ask you questions one by one. You can answer in short or in detail — whatever works for you.

🧠 Logical / Non-Technical Section — Step 1
Q1: What is the name of your app? (If you haven't finalized it, just write a placeholder or working title.)

You said:
SplitKar

ChatGPT said:
Awesome! Let’s proceed.

🧠 Logical / Non-Technical Section — Step 2
Q2: What problem does SplitKar solve? Think about:
* Why did you start this project?
* What pain point or need does it address?
* Is it for a specific group of people (e.g., students, friends, travelers)?
👉 Example: "SplitKar helps groups of friends split bills easily and keep track of who owes what." Feel free to describe it in your own words.

You said:
So the problem that it solves is while going to trip or managing daily expenses with our group of friends like sometimes I pay for others sometimes others pay for me so managing that becomes difficult right so we can here create a group create friends and we can manage them it is just a clone and or just an upgraded version of splitwise that i'm trying to make it for it for free it was it is a passion project not a passion project but i've started it to learn flutter and django together so this is my idea i have one or two more ideas which i want to implement which is not in splitwise which is mostly used by people although it is not free so i want my friends and my trip in my trip i'll use that app and the pain point is this only that the splitwise app is good but it is not free so i can develop my own app i am a developer i can deploy it and for a small extent i can use it for free so it is specific is it specific for a group of people no i mean anyone can use it if you're not a traveler you do you daily room with your friend so you can make a group of daily group and you can just add expenses in that so things that is difficult for me to implement i'll tell you later

ChatGPT said:
Perfect! That was a great and honest answer — I’ve converted it into a clean, polished form for your README’s logical section.
Let’s move on, but first, here’s what we’ve gathered so far:

📘 Project Name: SplitKar

🧠 Logical Overview
✨ What is SplitKar?
SplitKar is a smart expense-splitting app designed for managing shared costs in daily life, trips, or any group activities. Whether you're going on a vacation with friends, living with roommates, or splitting recurring bills — SplitKar helps you track, split, and settle expenses with ease.
🎯 Purpose of the Project
This project was started as a way to learn and practice both Flutter and Django together — one for building beautiful frontends and the other for a powerful backend. While it's inspired by apps like Splitwise, the main aim is to create a free and customizable alternative, tailored for real-life use among friends and groups.
SplitKar is not limited to any specific user group. Anyone who shares expenses — whether they’re students, roommates, travel groups, or colleagues — can benefit from it.

Now onto the next question:
🧠 Logical / Non-Technical Section — Step 3
Q3: What are the core features of your app (non-technical)? Please list or describe the key things users can do in the app. For example:
* Create groups
* Add friends
* Add expenses
* Track balances ... and anything else you’re planning to include now or later.
Just list what comes to your mind, and we’ll polish and organize it later.

You said:
So, the features that I've implemented till now, that I'll keep on updating in the readme. You can add friends, first of all it has a Google login, you can add friends, you can create groups. But, in that you cannot add expenses as of now because those models in Django and APIs are yet to be written. So, these are the things stated. One thing I've taken a care of a lot is the UI. The UI is very good, it is, like, wonderful. It is good for youngsters, you will feel something new. And, it is very smooth also. And, the features that I want to implement is, one by one I'll say it to you, expenses. And, in expenses, exactly same how Splitwise adds, if you are paying a bill in which you have to split, how many people you have to split. If two people are using to pay one single bill, you can pay that. You can divide them equally, percentage wise. And, later on when I grow well, I want to add payment also, that you can pay using that app. And, one thing that I want to implement which is not there in Splitwise is, is there, it is like making a wallet of a trip, a wallet of a group. So, what you can do is, you can do a KYC of the group, you can create a wallet. And, people can add those wallet, add money in that wallet and they can use it while in their trip. So, what happens is this, it is kind of good for people, which, in between whom there are very confusion, a lot of confusion that you have to pay or I'll have to pay, like that. So, it is better that you make a wallet and add money before that. If there is money, if you need to add more money in that, so it will show you which people have added less money, so they need to add. If money is left, then it will be equally divided in them. So, this is a feature that is a long way to come and it will take a lot to implement. But, this is one of the feature that I want to implement. And, you can also suggest in between, add your own features if you feel like which is not there in Spreadwise in this readme. Make sure to mention which features have been implemented and which I want to add, and format it beautifully.

ChatGPT said:
Amazing, Nishant! You've not only thought about the current state of your app but also its future vision, and that makes your project standout.
Here’s the updated Logical Section of the README, now including implemented features, planned features, and even innovative additions not present in Splitwise.

🧠 Logical Overview (continued)
🛠️ Features Overview
✅ Implemented Features
These features are already built and functional in the current version of SplitKar:
* 🔐 Google Login Authentication – Seamless sign-in using Google accounts.
* 👥 Friend Management – Add and manage friends in your network.
* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Group Creation – Create custom groups for trips, roommates, or shared expenses.
* 🎨 Modern UI – The user interface is beautifully crafted for the younger generation — minimal, smooth, and visually refreshing.
🧩 Planned / Upcoming Features
These features are part of the roadmap and will be added gradually:
* 💸 Expense Management
    * Add expenses within groups.
    * Choose who paid and how much.
    * Split expenses equally, by percentage, or custom amounts.
    * Support multiple payers for one bill.
* 💰 Trip Wallet System (Unique Idea 💡)
    * Create a wallet for a group or trip.
    * Members can add money in advance to the wallet.
    * Track who contributed how much and who needs to contribute more.
    * At the end of the trip, remaining money will be equally refunded or distributed.
    * Ideal for avoiding mid-trip confusion about who pays what.
* 🧾 Payment Integration
    * Allow users to pay each other directly via UPI or other methods within the app.
    * Link payment status with expense records.

This structure shows both your current progress and your ambitions clearly. 👏

🧠 Logical / Non-Technical Section — Step 4
Q4: Who is your target audience? Even though anyone can use it, whom do you imagine using this the most? (Examples: College students, young travelers, flatmates, office colleagues, etc.)
Just describe the kind of people who would benefit most from SplitKar.

You said:
Since if I want a larger audience to use it, I have to deploy it on a large scale and I have to make sure that I invest the money. So as of now, my goal is to just distribute it to my friends and get feedback from them and myself to use it. If successfully they use it and they give a good feedback, then it will be very helpful for me.

ChatGPT said:
That's a thoughtful and realistic approach, Nishant. You're starting small, validating with real users (your friends), and planning to expand only if the feedback is positive — exactly how great products begin!
Here’s how your target audience section now looks:

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Target Audience & Launch Plan
As of now, SplitKar is being built for personal use and private testing. The primary users will be:
* 👥 Close friends and acquaintances
* 🧑‍💻 The developer (Nishant) himself, using it for daily or trip-based expense tracking
The current focus is to:
* Gather honest feedback
* Monitor real-world usage
* Improve based on real pain points
Once feedback is positive and the core features are stable, there's a future scope for scaling it to a larger public audience.

Next up:
🧠 Logical / Non-Technical Section — Step 5
Q5: What is your app’s tone or vibe? Think about how you want users to feel when they use it. Fun? Professional? Minimal? Clean? Youthful? And if you’ve used any specific design ideas, color palettes, icons, or illustrations that reflect this mood, feel free to describe those too.

You said:
So, I will be giving you the photos of the app, I'll host it on Github, and I'll give you to add it, the vibe is very modern, very clean also, and the theme is purple, and it has very crazy UI, so I'll add, I'll give you links to add in the readme.

ChatGPT said:
Perfect! You’ve nailed the vibe and design intention 🎯
Here’s how this section of your README will look:

🎨 Design & Vibe
SplitKar features a modern and minimal yet visually exciting UI, built to appeal especially to younger users.
* 🌈 Theme: Primarily Purple
* 📱 Design Aesthetic: Smooth transitions, sleek layouts, and dynamic screens
* 🤘 Vibe: Youthful, energetic, clean, and different from typical finance apps
Once images or GitHub links are shared, screenshots and demo links will be added here to visually communicate the interface and flow.

Next up, we’ll begin the technical section! 🧑‍💻

⚙️ Technical Section — Step 1
Q6: How is your project structured technically? Please confirm these details or add/correct:
* Frontend: Flutter
* Backend: Django
* Auth: Google Login (Firebase or Django AllAuth or something else?)
* Database: Which one? PostgreSQL? SQLite?
* State Management in Flutter (if any used)?
* API Format: JSON APIs via Django REST Framework?
Just confirm or correct the above, and mention any other important tech used (like Firebase, Supabase, Celery, etc.)

You said:
So let's start with the Django part. So Django is using SQLite. It will be using PostgreSQL for deployment and APIs are written using Django REST framework. JWT token is used for the login. Of course, Google Authentication is used and only Django Google login is used using the Google console APIs that we use. Flutter takes the token. Flutter does the Google login. It sends the token to the Django API. Django verifies and allows it to login. And I have written multiple APIs in Django and as well as Flutter. In Flutter, I have written code so that it checks every time the user is logged in when the app is opened. I have used cache. So it is getting a little cluttered. I'll explain you once again one by one.So, about the Flutter. In Flutter, I have maintained the code very clean and formatted. Every part of the app has separate files. Every component has been made, like AppBarComponent, like NavBarComponent, DrawerComponent. Every small component is used, and I have made it properly. Cache is used for instant load in the Flutter. After instant load in the background, we do async operations to call the APIs. Of course, we have optimized the API calls, not again and again we are doing the API calls. In the backend side, the APIs are normal as of now, but we want to implement caching there as well.

ChatGPT said:
Fantastic, Nishant! You're already showing strong architecture thinking, API design awareness, and code modularity — this is going to make your README look very professional.
Here’s how the Technical Stack section is shaping up from what you've described:

⚙️ Technical Overview
🧱 Architecture Summary
SplitKar is a full-stack application built using:
Layer	Tech Stack
Frontend	Flutter (Dart)
Backend	Django (Python) with Django REST Framework (DRF)
Auth	Google Sign-In + JWT Authentication
Database	SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL (prod-ready)
API Format	REST (JSON)
Caching	Local caching in Flutter; planned caching in Django APIs

🧠 Authentication Flow
1. Google Sign-In in Flutter
    * The app uses Google Sign-In through Firebase or Google Console SDK (not AllAuth).
2. Token Exchange
    * Flutter receives the ID token from Google and sends it to Django.
3. JWT Generation in Django
    * Django verifies the token with Google and generates a JWT token for secure session handling.
4. Session Persistence
    * Flutter caches login state locally and checks on app start.

🧩 Flutter Code Practices
* 💡 Modular Design
    * Each component (AppBar, Drawer, NavBar, etc.) is separated for reusability and clarity.
* 🚀 Performance Optimization
    * Caching is used to show instant data while async calls fetch fresh data in the background.
    * API calls are optimized to avoid unnecessary network requests.

Up next:
⚙️ Technical Section — Step 2
Q7: How are you planning to deploy the app and backend? Tell me:
* Are you planning to host the backend on Render, Railway, Vercel, or something else?
* Will the Flutter app be deployed to the Play Store / TestFlight?
* Any CI/CD or GitHub Actions setup?
* Will this be open source, private repo, or public?
Just let me know your current or planned deployment strategy.

You said:
So, for deployment of the backend project, I'll host it on, yes, the services that I have mentioned, Render, Railway, or Vercel. For Flutter app, I have not explored yet, but PlayStore needs 2000 rupees, I'll think about that or any free service you might mention. This would be open source, I have not yet decided, but don't add this part of open source yet.

ChatGPT said:
Perfect, thanks for the clarity! I’ve drafted a clean and professional Deployment Strategy section based on your inputs (and I’ve excluded the open source part as instructed).

🚀 Deployment Strategy
🖥️ Backend (Django)
* The Django backend will be deployed on cloud platforms like Render, Railway, or Vercel, depending on scaling and database support.
* The production database will switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL for stability and performance.
📱 Frontend (Flutter)
* The Flutter app is currently under development and testing.
* Future deployment to the Google Play Store is planned — pending Play Console access and further exploration.
* Free hosting alternatives for web/preview (like Flutter Web on Firebase Hosting) may also be considered temporarily.

You’re building this very thoughtfully — gradually, but with scalability in mind. 🌱
Next up:
⚙️ Technical Section — Step 3
Q8: What APIs have you already implemented in Django? Just list them briefly. For example:
* Login verification
* Add friend
* Get groups
* etc.
You can list them one by one. We'll mark them as implemented and put your future APIs in a separate “Planned APIs” list.

You said:
Okay, so I'll give you the links, or sorry, I'll give you the URLs. You can try to understand if you have any doubts and you can ask me. from django.urls import path from django.contrib.admin.views.autocomplete import AutocompleteJsonView from . import views app_name = 'connections' urlpatterns = [ path('profile/lookup/<str:profile_code>/', views.lookup_profile_by_code, name='profile-lookup'), path('profile/list-others/', views.list_users_with_profiles, name='profile-list'), path('profile/list-all/', views.list_all_users, name='profile-list-all'), path('friend-request/pending/', views.list_pending_friend_requests, name='pending-friend-requests'), path('friend-request/send/', views.send_friend_request, name='send-friend-request'), path('friend-request/accept/', views.accept_friend_request, name='accept-friend-request'), path('friend-request/decline/', views.decline_friend_request, name='decline-friend-request'), path('friends/list/', views.get_friends_list, name='friends-list'), path('friends/remove/', views.remove_friend, name='remove-friend'), path('group/create/', views.create_group, name='create-group'), path('group/invite/', views.invite_to_group, name='invite-to-group'), path('group/remove-member/', views.remove_group_member, name='remove-group-member'), path('group/invitation/pending/', views.list_pending_group_invitations, name='list-pending-group-invitations'), path('group/invitation/accept/', views.accept_group_invitation, name='accept-group-invitation'), path('group/invitation/decline/', views.decline_group_invitation, name='decline-group-invitation'), path('group/list/', views.list_user_groups, name='list-user-groups'), path('group/batch-create/', views.batch_create_group, name='batch-create-group'), path('admin/user-lookup/', AutocompleteJsonView.as_view(), name='admin-user-lookup'), ] tion urlpatterns = [ # TODO: Add version prefix (e.g., 'api/v1/') path('auth/google/', GoogleLoginAPIView.as_view(), name='google-login'), path('auth/register/', UserRegistrationAPIView.as_view(), name='user-register'), path('auth/login/', UserLoginAPIView.as_view(), name='user-login'), path('auth/validate/', TokenVerifyView.as_view(), name='token-verify'), path('auth/token/refresh/', CustomTokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token-refresh'), path('profile/', ProfileDetailsAPIView, name='profile-details'), path('profile/update/', ProfileUpdateAPIView.as_view(), name='profile-update'), path('alerts/read-status/', AlertReadStatusView.as_view(), name='alert-read-status'), path('alerts/mark-read/', MarkAlertReadView.as_view(), name='mark-alert-read'), path('alerts/mark-all-read/', MarkAllAlertsReadView.as_view(), name='mark-all-read'), ]

ChatGPT said:
Amazing work, Nishant. You're building a real product-grade API layer — and you've already covered a lot of user flows: auth, friends, groups, alerts, and profile management.

⚙️ Technical Section — Step 4
Q9: What Flutter packages or libraries are you using? Please share the important packages (for example: http, provider, google_sign_in, flutter_secure_storage, etc.) Even better if you can paste from your pubspec.yaml or just list key ones here.

You said:

ChatGPT said:
Perfect, Nishant. You're using a clean and modern Flutter setup — this reflects a good mix of utility, animation, and clean storage handling.
Here's how I’ll format this in your README:

📦 Flutter Dependencies
SplitKar makes use of several powerful Flutter libraries to create a smooth, modern, and functional user experience:
Package	Purpose
google_fonts	Use stylish fonts for modern UI
google_sign_in	Google login integration
http	API communication
shared_preferences	Local persistent key-value storage
flutter_secure_storage	Secure storage for tokens
cached_network_image	Efficient image caching
provider	State management
lottie	Animations (loading, UI effects)
rive	Beautiful custom vector animations
stylish_bottom_bar	Custom bottom navigation bar
logger	Debug-friendly logging
logging	Structured log handling
You’ve also organized all components (like AppBar, Drawer, NavBar) as separate, reusable widgets which contributes to code cleanliness and performance.

✅ That completes the Tech Stack – Frontend (Flutter) section.

🧩 Next Step: Architecture Overview
Q10. How have you structured your Flutter app folder-wise? For example:
* Do you use folders like screens/, widgets/, services/, models/?
* Do you follow any specific architecture like MVVM, Clean Architecture, or just well-organized folders?
Give me a quick overview, and I’ll add a visual architecture diagram-style markdown in the README.

You said:
Um, how did you know I'm using folders like Screens, because I've made the same folder? So, I mean, yes, of course, I'll give you... But, how do you know that, and is there any specific folders that people make while making Flutter? For this, can you help me out a little? I want to show you the whole structure of the directory, so is there any command in Mac which I can use to show you the whole directory? also i have one info about the alkert structure in my app # SplitKar Alert System A real-time, optimized alert system for Flutter applications that handles individual alert updates without rebuilding the entire UI. ## Key Features - Real-time updates with optimistic UI - Per-alert state management - Smooth animations - Category-based filtering - Memory efficient ## Common Issues & Solutions ### 1. Deactivated Widget Context **Issue**:
Looking up a deactivated widget's ancestor is unsafe.
At this point the state of the widget's element tree is no longer stable.
**Solution**:
dart
// Before: Unsafe context usage
void handleAction() async {
  await someAsyncOperation();
  Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Crash if widget disposed
}

// After: Safe context usage
void handleAction() async {
  if (!context.mounted) return;
  await someAsyncOperation();
  if (context.mounted) {
    Navigator.of(context).pop(); // Safe
  }
}
### 2. List State Sync Issues **Issue**: AnimatedList getting out of sync with actual data, causing range errors. **Solution**:
dart
// Before: Complex AnimatedList management
AnimatedList(
  key: _listKey,
  itemBuilder: (context, index, animation) {
    // Complex state management prone to errors
  }
)

// After: Simplified stable ListView
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: filteredAlerts.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return AnimatedSize(
      child: AlertCard(...),
    );
  },
)
### 3. Memory Leaks **Issue**: Alerts not being properly cleaned up after processing. **Solution**:
dart
// Added proper cleanup in AlertService
Future<void> handleAlertAction() async {
  try {
    _processingAlerts.add(alertId);
    await action();
  } finally {
    _processingAlerts.remove(alertId); // Always cleanup
  }
}
### 4. UI Jank During Updates **Issue**: Entire list rebuilding when single alert changes. **Solution**:
dart
// Use Selector for granular updates
Selector<AlertService, bool>(
  selector: (_, service) => service.isProcessing(alert.id),
  builder: (context, isProcessing, child) => AlertCard(...),
)
### 5. Race Conditions **Issue**: Multiple async operations causing state inconsistencies. **Solution**:
dart
// Added Completer for proper async handling
Future<void> handleAlertAction() async {
  final actionCompleter = Completer<void>();
  
  action().then((value) {
    actionCompleter.complete();
  }).catchError((error) {
    actionCompleter.completeError(error);
  });
  
  await actionCompleter.future;
}
### 6. Category Management Issues **Issue**: Categories not updating properly when alerts change. **Solution**:
dart
void _updateSortedCategories() {
  _sortedCategories = AlertCategory.values.toList()
    ..sort((a, b) {
      // Prioritize categories with alerts
      if (aTotalCount > 0 && bTotalCount == 0) return -1;
      // Sort by response requirements
      if (aHasResponse != bHasResponse) return aHasResponse ? -1 : 1;
      return bCount.compareTo(aCount);
    });
}
## Creating Alerts ### 1. Basic Alert
dart
// Create a simple notification alert
final alert = AlertItem(
  id: 'notification_${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}',
  title: 'Welcome!',
  subtitle: 'Thanks for joining SplitKar',
  icon: Icons.notifications,
  actions: [],
  timestamp: DateTime.now(),
  category: AlertCategory.general,
);
### 2. Interactive Alert (e.g., Friend Request)
dart
// Create friend request alert with actions
void sendFriendRequest(BuildContext context, String username) {
  final alert = AlertItem(
    id: 'friend_request_${requestId}',
    title: 'Friend Request',
    subtitle: '$username wants to be your friend',
    icon: Icons.person_add,
    actions: [
      AlertAction(
        label: 'Accept',
        onPressed: () => handleFriendRequest(true),
        color: Colors.green,
      ),
      AlertAction(
        label: 'Decline',
        onPressed: () => handleFriendRequest(false),
        color: Colors.red,
      ),
    ],
    timestamp: DateTime.now(),
    category: AlertCategory.friendRequest,
    requiresResponse: true,
  );

  // Add to service
  context.read<AlertService>().addAlert(alert);
}
### 3. Group Invitation Alert
dart
// Create group invitation alert
void sendGroupInvite(BuildContext context, String groupName, String invitedBy) {
  final alert = AlertItem(
    id: 'group_invite_${inviteId}',
    title: 'Group Invitation',
    subtitle: '$invitedBy invited you to join $groupName',
    icon: Icons.group_add,
    imageUrl: groupImageUrl, // Optional group image
    actions: [
      AlertAction(
        label: 'Join',
        onPressed: () => handleGroupInvite(true),
        color: Colors.green,
      ),
      AlertAction(
        label: 'Skip',
        onPressed: () => handleGroupInvite(false),
        color: Colors.grey,
      ),
    ],
    timestamp: DateTime.now(),
    category: AlertCategory.groupInvite,
    requiresResponse: true,
  );
  
  context.read<AlertService>().addAlert(alert);
}
## Displaying Alerts ### 1. Show Alert Sheet
dart
// In your widget/screen
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () => AlertSheet.show(context),
  child: Text('Show Alerts'),
)
### 2. Show Alert Count Badge
dart
// In your app bar or navigation
Badge(
  label: Text(context.select(
    (AlertService s) => s.totalCount.toString(),
  )),
  child: IconButton(
    icon: Icon(Icons.notifications),
    onPressed: () => AlertSheet.show(context),
  ),
)
### 3. Listen for Alert Updates
dart
// In your widget
Consumer<AlertService>(
  builder: (context, service, child) {
    return Text('You have ${service.totalCount} notifications');
  },
)
## How It Works ### 1. Alert Service (Single Source of Truth)
dart
class AlertService extends ChangeNotifier {
  List<AlertItem> _alerts = [];
  Set<String> _processingAlerts = {}; // Track processing state per alert
  
  // Optimistic update example
  Future<void> handleAlertAction(String alertId, Future<void> Function() action) async {
    _processingAlerts.add(alertId);
    _updateSingleAlert(alertId); // Update UI immediately
    
    try {
      await action(); // Execute in background
    } finally {
      _processingAlerts.remove(alertId);
    }
  }
}
### 2. Efficient UI Updates
dart
// Instead of rebuilding entire list
ListView.builder(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return Selector<AlertService, bool>( // Only rebuild single alert
      selector: (_, service) => service.isProcessing(alert.id),
      builder: (context, isProcessing, child) => AlertCard(
        alert: alert,
        isProcessing: isProcessing,
      ),
    );
  },
)
## Best Practices 1. **Single Alert Updates**: Update individual alerts instead of the whole list
dart
void _updateSingleAlert(String alertId) {
  _alerts.removeWhere((a) => a.id == alertId);
  notifyListeners(); // Only triggers rebuild for affected alert
}
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI before API call completes
dart
// In your widget
if (isProcessing) {
  return LoadingState(); // Show immediately
}
3. **Category Management**: Efficient filtering
dart
final filteredAlerts = _selectedFilter == null
    ? alerts
    : alerts.where((a) => a.category == _selectedFilter);
## Performance Tips - Use Selector for granular rebuilds - Implement shouldRebuild for complex widgets - Keep animations lightweight - Cache filtered results when possible For more details, check the implementation in alert_service.dart and alert_sheet.dart.
